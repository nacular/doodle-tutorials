# [Todo](https://github.com/nacular/doodle-tutorials/tree/master/Todo) Tutorial

This tutorial shows how you might build the [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) app using Doodle. This version deviates from the official app spec in that (like all Doodle apps) it does not use CSS or HTML directly. Therefore, it does not include the assets provided by the official spec. Instead, it replicates the UX with Doodle primitives.

This version is also designed to work well as an embedded app. The version below (unlike the full-screen version) does not use routing for the filters. This means there is no way to deep-link to a filter, like the full-screen version has. The launch code decides this by injecting a different strategy for creating the filter buttons, while the app itself is unaware of this difference.

## Project Setup

The app will use a Kotlin Multiplatform setup, which means we can run it on a range of targets supported by Doodle. The directory structure follows a fairly common layout, with common classes and resources in one source set and platform-specific items in their own.

export const sourceTree = sanitize([
{ label: 'src', children: [
    { label: 'commonMain', children: [
        { label: 'kotlin'    },
    ] },
    { label: 'jsMain', children: [
        { label: 'kotlin'    },
        { label: 'resources' },
    ] },
    { label: 'jvmMain', children: [{ label: 'kotlin' }] },
    { label: 'wasmJsMain', children: [
        { label: 'kotlin'    },
        { label: 'resources' },
    ] },
]},
{ label: 'build.gradle.kts' }
]);

:::info Directory Layout

<BasicRichTreeView items={sourceTree} defaultExpandedItems={["src", "src/commonMain"]} defaultSelectedItem={"src"}>

<div value="src">

All source code and resources are located under the `src` directory.

The application logic itself is located in the common source set (`src/commonMain`), which means it is entirely reused for each platform. In fact, the same app is used unchanged (just targeting JS) within this documentation.

</div><div value="src/commonMain">

Source code and resources for that are usable for platforms are stored in `commonMain`. This app is designed to work on all platforms, so our app code and all logic is found under this directory.

There are also a couple interfaces that need platform-specific implementations that are defined here: `PersistentStore` and `Router`. This allows our app to work with them in a platform independent way, even if they will vary depending on the target it is run on.

</div><div value="src/commonMain/kotlin">

The `kotlin` directory is where all code for a platform resides. In this case, we have all the classes for our app, including `TodoApp`, `TaskRow`, `FilterBox`, `Router`, etc..

All of these classes are platform agnostic and used by all targets. This makes our app work on any target Doodle supports.

</div><div value="src/jsMain">

Source code and resources that are needed for Web (JS) target are stored in `jsMain`. Our app is platform agnostic except for the launch portion, which is located in the source below this directory.

</div><div value="src/jsMain/kotlin">

The Web launch portion of our app is located here in the program's `main` function. The JS version uses a platform-specific `LocalStorePersistence` that is based on the browser's `LocalStorage`. It also have a `TrivialRouter` that uses `window.location.hash` to track/update routes.

</div><div value="src/jsMain/resources">

Holds the `index.html` file that loads the generated JS file produced for the Web (JS) target.

</div><div value="src/jvmMain">

Source code and resources that are needed for Desktop (JVM) target are stored in `jvmMain`.

</div><div value="src/jvmMain/kotlin">

The Desktop launch portion of our app is located here in the program's `main` function. This version uses a platform-specific `FilePersistence` that is based on the file system via `java.io.File`. It also has an `InMemoryRouter` that uses a hashmap internally to track/update routes.

</div><div value="src/wasmJsMain">

Source code and resources that are needed for Web (WASM) target are stored in `wasmJsMain`. Our app is platform agnostic except for the launch portion, which is located in the source below this directory.

</div><div value="src/wasmJsMain/kotlin">

The Web launch portion of our app is located here in the program's `main` function. The WASM version uses a platform-specific `LocalStorePersistence` that is based on the browser's `LocalStorage`. It also have a `TrivialRouter` that uses `window.location.hash` to track/update routes.

</div><div value="src/wasmJsMain/resources">

Holds the `index.html` file that loads the generated JS file produced for the Web (WASM) target.

</div><div value="build.gradle.kts">

The `build.gradle.kts` file defines how the app is configured and all its dependencies. The Todo app uses a multi-platform configuration so it can run on all Doodle supported targets.

</div>

:::

Doodle apps are built using gradle like other Kotlin apps. The build is controlled by the `build.gradle.kts` script in the root of the `Todo` directory.

**build.gradle.kts**

<KPlayground>{Gradle}</KPlayground>

:::info
The gradle build uses [gradle version catalogs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/version_catalogs.html); see [libs.versions.toml](https://github.com/nacular/doodle-tutorials/blob/master/gradle/libs.versions.toml) file for library info.

## The Application

All Doodle apps must implement the [`Application`](https://nacular.github.io/doodle/docs/applications) interface. The framework will then initialize our app via the constructor.

Doodle apps can be defined in `commonMain`, since they do not require any platform-specific dependencies (we will do this as well). They can also be [launched](https://nacular.github.io/doodle/docs/applications) in a few different ways on Web and Desktop. Use the `application` function in a platform source-set (i.e. `jsMain`, `jvmMain`, etc.) to launch top-level apps. It takes a list of modules to load and a lambda that builds the app. This lambda is within a Kodein injection context, which means we can inject dependencies into our app via `instance`, `provider`, etc.

:::tip
Notice that `shutdown` is a no-op, since we don't have any cleanup to do when the app closes.

Use the `application` function to launch top-level apps. It takes a list of modules, and a lambda that builds the app. This lambda is within a Kodein injection context, which means we can inject dependencies into our app via `instance`, `provider`, etc.

Notice that we have included several modules for our app. This includes one for fonts, pointer, keyboard, and several for various View [`Behaviors`](https://nacular.github.io/doodle/docs/rendering/behaviors) (i.e. [`nativeTextFieldBehavior()`](https://nacular.github.io/doodle-api/browser/io.nacular.doodle.theme.native/-native-theme/-companion/native-text-field-behavior.html)) which loads the native behavior for TextFields. We also define some bindings directly in a new module. These are items with no built-in module, or items that only exist in our app code.

:::tip
Check out Kodein to learn more about how it handles dependency injection.
:::

The `application` function also takes an optional HTML element within which the app will be hosted. The app will be hosted in `document.body` if you do not specify an element.

App launching is the only part of our code that is platform-specific; since it is the only time we might care about an HTML element. It also helps support embedding apps into non-Doodle contexts.

## Supporting Docs Embedding

These docs actually launch the app using a custom `main` with a slightly different set of inputs. The big difference is in `FilterButtonProvider` used. The docs inject a provider that creates `PushButton`s instead of `HyperLink`s for the filter controls. The app itself treats these the same. The end result is that the docs version does not use routing.

<KPlayground>{`
// Notice the element is provided for embedded version
application(root = element, modules = listOf(FontModule, PointerModule, KeyboardModule, basicLabelBehavior(),
        nativeTextFieldBehavior(), nativeHyperLinkBehavior(), nativeScrollPanelBehavior(smoothScrolling = true),
        Module(name = "AppModule") {
            // ...

            // Different behavior for docs version
            bind<FilterButtonProvider>() with singleton { EmbeddedFilterButtonProvider(instance()) }
        }
)) {
    // load app just like full-screen
    TodoApp(instance(), instance(), instance(), instance(), instance(), instance(), instance(), instance(), instance(), instance())
}
