# [Photo Stream](https://github.com/nacular/doodle-tutorials/tree/master/PhotoStream) Tutorial

We will build a simple Doodle app that displays an infinite stream of photos that are lazily loaded from [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com).
The photos will be shown in a list that continuously grows as the user scrolls to the bottom.

<div style={{textAlign:'center', margin: '3em 0'}}>
    <video autoPlay loop muted playsInline width="400px">
      <source type="video/mp4" src="/doodle-tutorials/photo_stream_desktop.mov"/>
      <p>Your browser does not support the video element.</p>
    </video>
</div>

The first thing we need is an **Unsplash API** key. Take a look at their [developer documentation](https://unsplash.com/documentation) to obtain one.
A key is required to make API requests and fetch image urls.

## Project Setup

We will use a JS only-setup for this app. Our app will use Ktor for the HTTP client and Kotlin Serialization to unmarshal the resulting JSON.
We also need Kotlin's Coroutines library to load images asynchronously.

## The Application

Our application will be fairly simple. It will create a [`DynamicList`](https://nacular.github.io/doodle/docs/ui_components/overview#list)
with a data model bound to Unsplash's APIs. This list will be within a [`ScrollPanel`](https://nacular.github.io/doodle-api/core/io.nacular.doodle.controls.panels/-scroll-panel)
that fits the [`Display`](https://nacular.github.io/doodle/docs/display/overview) height.

```kotlin
class PhotoStreamApp(display    : Display,
                     themes     : ThemeManager,
                     theme      : DynamicTheme,
                     httpClient : HttpClient,
                     imageLoader: ImageLoader): Application {
    init {
        // For scroll panel behavior
        themes.selected = theme

        val appScope    = CoroutineScope(SupervisorJob() + Dispatchers.Default)
        val imageHeight = 400.0

        // List to hold images
        val list = DynamicList(
            model          = UnSplashDataModel(appScope, httpClient, imageLoader),
            itemVisualizer = itemVisualizer { image, recycledView, _ -> when(recycledView) {
                is CenterCroppedPhoto -> recycledView.also { recycledView.image = image }
                else                  -> CenterCroppedPhoto(image)
            } }
        ).apply {
            behavior      = BasicListBehavior(rowHeight = imageHeight)
            cellAlignment = fill
        }

        display += ScrollPanel(list).apply {
            // Ensure list's width is equal to scroll-panel's
            contentWidthConstraints = { parent.width }
        }

        display.layout = constrain(display.children[0]) {
            it.width   = min(parent.width, constant(imageHeight))
            it.height  = parent.height
            it.centerX = parent.centerX
        }
    }

    override fun shutdown() {}
}
```

DynamicList monitors its model for changes and updates whenever items are added, removed, or moved. This means we can simply change the underlying
model to get a list that grows.

:::tip
`DynamicList`, like [`List`](https://nacular.github.io/doodle-api/controls/io.nacular.doodle.controls.list/-list) and [`MutableList`](https://nacular.github.io/doodle-api/controls/io.nacular.doodle.controls.list/-mutable-list) recycle their contents to avoid rendering items that are not displayed. The `scrollCache` constructor parameter controls the amount of items in the buffer. Passing nothing means we get a default of 10 items cached beyond what is visible.
:::

## Binding To Unsplash Data

DynamicList requires a [`DynamicListModel`](https://nacular.github.io/doodle-api/controls/io.nacular.doodle.controls/-dynamic-list-model) to hold its data, so we need to create one that binds to Unsplash.

```kotlin
class UnSplashDataModel(private val accessToken: String = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN", /*...*/): DynamicListModel<Image> {
    // ...

    private var currentPage: Int by observable(-1) { /*...*/ }

    private val pageSize               = 5
    private val unsplashLocation get() = "https://api.unsplash.com/photos/?client_id=$accessToken&page=$currentPage&per_page=$pageSize"

    override val size get() = loadedImages.size

    override val changed = SetPool<ModelObserver<Image>>()

    // Internal list used to cache images loaded from unsplash
    private val loadedImages = ObservableList<Image>()

    override fun get(index: Int): Image? = loadedImages.getOrNull(index).also {
        // ...
    }

    override fun contains(value: Image           ) = value in loadedImages
    override fun iterator(                       ) = loadedImages.iterator()
    override fun section (range: ClosedRange<Int>) = loadedImages.subList(range.start, range.endInclusive + 1)
}
```

Our model will cache a local [`ObservableList`](https://nacular.github.io/doodle-api/core/io.nacular.doodle.utils/-observable-list) of images via `loadedImages`. This list will provide the model state our list uses to render. The model will then fetch paginated images from Unsplash and load the resulting urls asynchronously into this list.

We track the `currentPage` and `pageSize` to fetch a growing list of pages from Unsplash. We fetch a new page whenever the `currentPage` is
updated.

```kotlin
class UnSplashDataModel(private val scope: CoroutineScope, /*...*/): DynamicListModel<Image> {
    // ...

    private var httpRequestJob: Job? by observable(null) { _,old,_ ->
        old?.cancel()
    }

    private var currentPage: Int by observable(-1) { _,_ ->
        fetchActive    = true
        httpRequestJob = scope.launch {
            val results = client.get<List<UnsplashPhoto>>(unsplashLocation)

            loadedImages.addAll(results.mapNotNull { imageLoader.load(it.urls.small) })

            fetchActive = false

            if (nextPageNeeded) {
                nextPageNeeded  = false
                currentPage    += 1
            }
        }
    }

    // ...
}
```

Fetches are performed using Ktor's HttpClient configured to read JSON data. These reads are done via Kotlin Serialization into the `UnsplashPhoto`
data class. We only use the `small` value in the `urls` property from the JSON response, so our data classes are much simpler than the full
Unsplash API.

```kotlin
class UnSplashDataModel(httpClient: HttpClient, /*...*/): DynamicListModel<Image> {
    // ...

    @Serializable
    data class Urls(val small: String)

    @Serializable
    data class UnsplashPhoto(val id: String, val urls: Urls)

    // HTTP client configured to read JSON  returned from unsplash
    private val client = httpClient.config {
        install(JsonFeature) {
            serializer = KotlinxSerializer(Json { ignoreUnknownKeys = true })
        }
    }

    // ...
}
```

Our `loadedImages` list triggers an event whenever we add a new set of images to it. We use this fact to notify of changes to the model, which get
reflected by the `DynamicList`.

```kotlin
class UnSplashDataModel(/*...*/): DynamicListModel<Image> {
    // ...

    override val changed = SetPool<ModelObserver<Image>>()

    // Internal list used to cache images loaded from unsplash
    private val loadedImages = ObservableList<Image>().also {
        it.changed += { _ ,removed, added, moved ->
            // notify model observers whenever the underlying list changes (due to image loads)
            changed.forEach {
                it(this, removed, added, moved)
            }
        }
    }

    // ...
}
```

Finally, we need to decide when to fetch more images. We do this whenever `get` is called on the last image of the model. This happens when
the `DynamicList` needs to present that image, and is a good indication that it has reached the end.

```kotlin
class UnSplashDataModel(/*...*/): DynamicListModel<Image> {
    // ...

    override fun get(index: Int): Image? = loadedImages.getOrNull(index).also {
        // Load the next page if the last image is fetched from the model
        if (index == size - 1) {
            when {
                fetchActive -> nextPageNeeded  = true
                else        -> currentPage    += 1
            }
        }
    }

    // ...
}
```

## Presenting The Images

Our `DynamicList` holds a list of `Image` items, but these are not `View`s. Which means we need a way of visualizing them. Many Doodle containers use this concept of an [`ItemVisualizer`](https://nacular.github.io/doodle-api/controls/io.nacular.doodle.controls/-item-visualizer). It is essentially a class that maps from some type `T` to `View` based on a set of inputs. `DynamicList` takes an `itemVisualizer` in its constructor that can be used by is `behavior` to render the contents of each row. Our app uses the `BasicListBehavior` to configure our list. Internally, that behavior takes the list's visualizer and creates a new `View` that is wrapped in another that represents the row itself. So it is sufficient to specify a visualizer that renders our images.

:::tip
It is also possible to change the way `BasicListBehavior` (and any `ListBehavior`) represents its rows by specifying it's [`RowGenerator`](https://nacular.github.io/doodle-api/controls/io.nacular.doodle.controls.theme/-tree-behavior/-row-generator).
:::

```kotlin
class PhotoStreamApp(/*...*/): Application {
    init {
        // ...

        val list = DynamicList(
            model          = UnSplashDataModel(appScope, httpClient, imageLoader),
            itemVisualizer = itemVisualizer { image, recycledView, _ -> when(recycledView) {
                is CenterCroppedPhoto -> recycledView.also { recycledView.image = image }
                else                  -> CenterCroppedPhoto(image)
            } }
        ).apply {
            behavior      = BasicListBehavior(rowHeight = imageHeight)
            cellAlignment = fill
        }
    }

    // ...
}
```

:::tip
`ItemVisualizer` is designed to support recycling. Each invocation may provide a recycled View that might be reusable for the new item. This lets
us reuse the `CenterCroppedPhoto` instances as the list scrolls.
:::

We will render each image as with a center-crop using `CenterCroppedPhoto`. This class holds an image that it renders with a centered square crop. The
crop square's length is equal to the image's width or height (whichever is smaller). That center region is then scaled to fit the cropped photo View's
bounds.

```kotlin
class CenterCroppedPhoto(image: Image): View() {
    private lateinit var centerCrop: Rectangle

    var image: Image = image
        set(new) {
            field        = new
            val cropSize = min(image.width, image.height)
            centerCrop   = Rectangle((image.width - cropSize) / 2, (image.height - cropSize) / 2, cropSize, cropSize)

            rerender()
        }

    init {
        this.image = image // ensure setter called, so centerCrop initialized
    }

    override fun render(canvas: Canvas) {
        canvas.image(image, source = centerCrop, destination = bounds.atOrigin)
    }
}
```
