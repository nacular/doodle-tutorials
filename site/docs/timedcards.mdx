# [TimedCards](https://github.com/nacular/doodle-tutorials/tree/master/TimedCards) Tutorial

This is a simple app that shows the flexibility of Doodle Carousels. It is inspired by [Giulio Cuscito's "Timed Cards Opening"](https://dribbble.com/shots/11012652--Timed-Cards-Opening). This app is multi-platform, which means it will run in the browser and as a desktop application.

The entire app rests on [Doodle's powerful Carousel APIs](https://nacular.github.io/doodle/docs/ui_components/overview#carousel) to create the layout and smooth, perfectly-timed transitions.

You can also see the full-screen app here: [JavaScript](https://nacular.github.io/doodle-tutorials/timedcards), [WebAssembly](https://nacular.github.io/doodle-tutorials/timedcards_wasm).

## Project Setup

The app will use a Kotlin Multiplatform setup, which means we can run it on a range of targets supported by Doodle. The directory structure follows a fairly common layout, with common classes and resources in one source set and platform-specific items in their own.

export const sourceTree = sanitize([
{ label: 'src', children: [
    { label: 'commonMain', children: [
        { label: 'kotlin'    },
    ] },
    { label: 'jsMain', children: [
        { label: 'kotlin'    },
        { label: 'resources' },
    ] },
    { label: 'jvmMain', children: [{ label: 'kotlin' }] },
    { label: 'wasmJsMain', children: [
        { label: 'kotlin'    },
        { label: 'resources' },
    ] },
]},
{ label: 'build.gradle.kts' }
]);

:::info Directory Layout

<BasicRichTreeView items={sourceTree} defaultExpandedItems={["src", "src/commonMain"]} defaultSelectedItem={"src"}>

<div value="src">

All source code and resources are located under the `src` directory.

The application logic itself is located in the common source set (`src/commonMain`), which means it is entirely reused for each platform. In fact, the same app is used unchanged (just targeting JS) within this documentation.

</div><div value="src/commonMain">

Source code and resources for that are usable for platforms are stored in `commonMain`. This app is designed to work on all platforms, so our app code and all logic is found under this directory.

</div><div value="src/commonMain/kotlin">

The `kotlin` directory is where all code for a platform resides. In this case, we have all the classes for our app, including `TimedCardsApp`, `Card`, `CardPresenter`, `ButtonControls` and `Utils`.

All of these classes are platform agnostic and used by all targets. This makes our app work on any target Doodle supports.

</div><div value="src/jsMain">

Source code and resources that are needed for Web (JS) target are stored in `jsMain`. Our app is platform agnostic except for the launch portion, which is located in the source below this directory.

</div><div value="src/jsMain/kotlin">

The Web launch portion of our app is located here in the program's `main` function.

</div><div value="src/jsMain/resources">

Holds the `index.html` file that loads the generated JS file produced for the Web (JS) target.

</div><div value="src/jvmMain">

Source code and resources that are needed for Desktop (JVM) target are stored in `jvmMain`.

</div><div value="src/jvmMain/kotlin">

The Desktop launch portion of our app is located here in the program's `main` function.

</div><div value="src/wasmJsMain">

Source code and resources that are needed for Web (WASM) target are stored in `wasmJsMain`. Our app is platform agnostic except for the launch portion, which is located in the source below this directory.

</div><div value="src/wasmJsMain/kotlin">

The Web launch portion of our app is located here in the program's `main` function.

</div><div value="src/wasmJsMain/resources">

Holds the `index.html` file that loads the generated JS file produced for the Web (WASM) target.

</div><div value="build.gradle.kts">

The `build.gradle.kts` file defines how the app is configured and all its dependencies. The TimedCards app uses a multi-platform configuration so it can run on all Doodle supported targets.

</div>

:::

Doodle apps are built using gradle like other Kotlin apps. The build is controlled by the `build.gradle.kts` script in the root of the `TimedCards` directory.

**build.gradle.kts**

<KPlayground>{Gradle}</KPlayground>

:::info
The gradle build uses [gradle version catalogs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/version_catalogs.html); see [libs.versions.toml](https://github.com/nacular/doodle-tutorials/blob/master/gradle/libs.versions.toml) file for library info.
:::

## The Application

All Doodle apps must implement the [`Application`](https://nacular.github.io/doodle/docs/applications) interface. The framework will then initialize our app via the constructor. Our app will be fairly simple: just create an instance of our calculator and add it to the display.

Doodle apps can be defined in `commonMain`, since they do not require any platform-specific dependencies (we will do this as well). They can also be [launched](https://nacular.github.io/doodle/docs/applications) in a few different ways on Web and Desktop. Use the `application` function in a platform source-set (i.e. `jsMain`, `jvmMain`, etc.) to launch top-level apps. It takes a list of modules to load and a lambda that builds the app. This lambda is within a Kodein injection context, which means we can inject dependencies into our app via `instance`, `provider`, etc.

:::tip
Notice that `shutdown` is a no-op, since we don't have any cleanup to do when the app closes.

## The Card Presenter

This app has a single Carousel that contains almost all of the UI elements. And that Carousel is driven by a custom `Presenter` that manages the layout and animation of the cards within it.

The cards in the Carousel can be in 3 key positions. The first position is that of the selected card, which fills the Carousel and has larger text displayed to the left. The first small card is in the second important position. And the cards to the right of the first card a all in the last key position.

The second position is treated as special because it has to support the transition from small to large card. Therefore the `CardPresenter` needs to track it directly.

<KPlayground>{CardPresenter}</KPlayground>

This presenter is all it takes to handle all the positioning for the Carousel's contents.

## Transitioner

Carousel's also expose a way to manage their automatic movement between frames. This includes changing frames or when a manual move is completed and the Carousel needs to move to a valid frame.

This app uses the `DampedTransitioner` with an animation for auto frame selection. This Transitioner provides a critically damped spring behavior to smoothly complete manual movement (which happens after a swipe for example). And the animation provided by our app is used during frame jumps.

<KPlayground>{`
behavior = object: CarouselBehavior<CardData> {
    override val presenter = CardPresenter<CardData> { itemSize(it) }

    override val transitioner = dampedTransitioner<CardData>(timer, scheduler) { _,_,_, update ->
        animate(0f to 1f, using = tweenFloat(easeInOutCubic, duration = 1.25 * seconds)) {
            update(it)
        }
    }
}
`}</KPlayground>

## Carousel Interactions

The app uses a floating View with controls to interact with the Carousel and monitor its progress. The two buttons trigger `Carousel.previous()` and `Carousel.next()` to switch back and forth between frames. While the progress bar and frame text listen for `Carousel.progressChanged` and update accordingly.

**Button Controls**

<KPlayground>{ButtonControls}</KPlayground>

## Cards

The cards shown in the Carousel are very dynamic and change what they show when moving from their small to large size.
