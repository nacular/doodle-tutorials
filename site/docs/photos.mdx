# [Photos](https://github.com/nacular/doodle-tutorials/tree/master/Photos) Tutorial

We will build a simple photo app that lets you view and manipulate images using a pointer or multi-touch. Images will be added to the app via drag-drop. You can then move, size, and rotate them with a mouse, pointer, touch, or via an info overlay.

Here is the end result.

<DoodleCodeBlock function="photos" height="700" />

## Project Setup

The app will use a Kotlin Multiplatform setup, which means we can run it on a range of targets supported by Doodle. The directory structure follows a fairly common layout, with common classes and resources in one source set and platform-specific items in their own.

export const sourceTree = sanitize([
{ label: 'src', children: [
    { label: 'commonMain', children: [
        { label: 'kotlin'    },
        { label: 'resources' },
    ] },
    { label: 'jsMain', children: [
        { label: 'kotlin'    },
        { label: 'resources' },
    ] },
    { label: 'jvmMain', children: [{ label: 'kotlin' }] },
    { label: 'wasmJsMain', children: [
        { label: 'kotlin'    },
        { label: 'resources' },
    ] },
]},
{ label: 'build.gradle.kts' }
]);

:::info Directory Layout

<BasicRichTreeView items={sourceTree} defaultExpandedItems={["src", "src/commonMain"]} defaultSelectedItem={"src"}>

<div value="src">

All source code and resources are located under the `src` directory.

The application logic itself is located in the common source set (`src/commonMain`), which means it is entirely reused for each platform. In fact, the same app is used unchanged (just targeting JS) within this documentation.

</div><div value="src/commonMain">

Source code and resources for that are usable for platforms are stored in `commonMain`. This app is designed to work on all platforms, so our app code and all logic is found under this directory.

</div><div value="src/commonMain/kotlin">

The `kotlin` directory is where all code for a platform resides. In this case, we have all the classes for our app including `PhotosApp`, `GestureRecognizer` and `Utils`.

All of these classes are platform agnostic and used by all targets. This makes our app work on any target Doodle supports.

</div><div value="src/commonMain/resources">

An app can have resources like fonts, images, etc. that it loads at runtime. This directory contains these resources.

In our case, we will be loading 2 default images we store here.

</div><div value="src/jsMain">

Source code and resources that are needed for Web (JS) target are stored in `jsMain`. Our app is platform agnostic except for the launch portion, which is located in the source below this directory.

</div><div value="src/jsMain/kotlin">

The Web launch portion of our app is located here in the program's `main` function.

</div><div value="src/jsMain/resources">

Holds the `index.html` file that loads the generated JS file produced for the Web (JS) target.

</div><div value="src/jvmMain">

Source code and resources that are needed for Desktop (JVM) target are stored in `jvmMain`.

</div><div value="src/jvmMain/kotlin">

The Desktop launch portion of our app is located here in the program's `main` function.

</div><div value="src/wasmJsMain">

Source code and resources that are needed for Web (WASM) target are stored in `wasmJsMain`. Our app is platform agnostic except for the launch portion, which is located in the source below this directory.

</div><div value="src/wasmJsMain/kotlin">

The Web launch portion of our app is located here in the program's `main` function.

</div><div value="src/wasmJsMain/resources">

Holds the `index.html` file that loads the generated JS file produced for the Web (WASM) target.

</div><div value="build.gradle.kts">

The `build.gradle.kts` file defines how the app is configured and all its dependencies. The Photos app uses a multi-platform configuration so it can run on all Doodle supported targets.

</div>

:::

Doodle apps are built using gradle like other Kotlin apps. The build is controlled by the `build.gradle.kts` script in the root of the `Photos` directory.

**build.gradle.kts**

<KPlayground>{Gradle}</KPlayground>

:::info
The gradle build uses [gradle version catalogs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/version_catalogs.html); see [libs.versions.toml](https://github.com/nacular/doodle-tutorials/blob/master/gradle/libs.versions.toml) file for library info.
:::

## The Application

All Doodle apps must implement the [`Application`](https://nacular.github.io/doodle/docs/applications) interface. The framework will then initialize our app via the constructor.

Doodle apps can be [launched](https://nacular.github.io/doodle/docs/applications) in a few different ways on Web and Desktop. Use the `application` function in a platform source-set (i.e. `jsMain`, `jvmMain`, etc.) to launch top-level apps. It takes a list of modules to load and a lambda that builds the app. This lambda is within a Kodein injection context, which means we can inject dependencies into our app via `instance`, `provider`, etc.

The app's structure is fairly simple. It has a main Container that holds the images and supports drag-drop, and a panel with controls for manipulating a selected image.

[**PhotosApp.kt**](https://github.com/nacular/doodle-tutorials/blob/master/Photos/src/commonMain/kotlin/io/nacular/doodle/examples/PhotosApp.kt#L11)

<KPlayground>{`
class PhotosApp(/*...*/): Application {
    init {
        // ...

        val panelToggle                 // Button used to show/hide the panel
        val panel                       // Has controls for manipulating images
        val mainContainer = container { // container that holds images
            // ...

            dropReceiver = object: DropReceiver {
                // support drag-drop importing
            }

            GlobalScope.launch {
                listOf("tetons.jpg", "earth.jpg").forEachIndexed { index, file ->
                    // load default images
                }
            }
        }

        display += listOf(mainContainer, panel, panelToggle)

        // ...
    }

    override fun shutdown() {}
}
`}</KPlayground>

:::tip
Notice that `shutdown` is a no-op, since we don't have any cleanup to do when the app closes.
:::

<KPlayground>{WebMain}</KPlayground>

:::tip
Normally this would just be your `main` function. But `main` would prevent the app from being used as a library. Which is what happens to allow both an embedded (in the docs) and full-screen version.
:::

The `application` function launches apps. It takes a list of modules, and a lambda that builds the
app. This lambda is within a Kodein injection context, which means we can inject dependencies into our app via
`instance`, `provider`, etc.

Notice that we have included several modules for our app. This includes one for focus, keyboard, drag-drop and several for various View [`Behaviors`](https://nacular.github.io/doodle/docs/rendering/behaviors) (i.e. [`nativeTextFieldBehavior()`](https://nacular.github.io/doodle-api/browser/io.nacular.doodle.theme.native/-native-theme/-companion/native-text-field-behavior.html)) which loads the native behavior for TextFields. We also define some bindings directly in a new module. These are items with no built-in module, or items that only exist in our app code.

:::tip
Check out Kodein to learn more about how it handles dependency injection.
:::

The `application` function also takes an optional HTML element within which the app will be hosted. The app will be hosted in `document.body` if you do not specify an element.

App launching is the only part of our code that is platform-specific; since it is the only time we might care about an HTML element. It also helps support embedding apps into non-Doodle contexts.

## Drag-drop Support

Drag-drop support requires the [`DragDropModule`](https://nacular.github.io/doodle/docs/dragdrop) to work. It then requires setting up drag/drop recognizers on the source/target Views. We created the `mainContainer` for this. You can see that the `dropReceiver` property is set to a `DropReceiver` that controls how the `mainContainer` handles drop events.

<KPlayground>{`
class PhotosApp(/*...*/ private val images: ImageLoader /*...*/): Application {
    init {
        // ...
        val mainContainer = container {
            // ...

            dropReceiver = object: DropReceiver {
                private  val allowedFileTypes                    = Files(ImageType("jpg"), ImageType("jpeg"), ImageType("png"))
                override val active                              = true
                private  fun allowed          (event: DropEvent) = allowedFileTypes in event.bundle
                override fun dropEnter        (event: DropEvent) = allowed(event)
                override fun dropOver         (event: DropEvent) = allowed(event)
                override fun dropActionChanged(event: DropEvent) = allowed(event)
                override fun drop             (event: DropEvent) = event.bundle[allowedFileTypes]?.let { files ->
                    val photos = files.map { GlobalScope.async { images.load(it)?.let { FixedAspectPhoto(it) } } }

                    GlobalScope.launch {
                        photos.mapNotNull { it.await() }.forEach { photo ->
                            import(photo, event.location)
                        }
                    }
                    true
                } ?: false
            }
        }
    }

    // ...
}
`}</KPlayground>

Our `DropReceiver` specifies the supported file-types (jpg, jpeg, and png). It then checks that any drop event contains valid files before accepting it. The `drop(event: DropEvent)` method is called when the user attempts the final drop. Here, the receiver fetches all the allowed files in the bundle, and tries to load and import each one. Notice that the receiver converts raw Image returned by `ImageLoader` into a `FixedAspectPhoto`.

## Importing An Image

We import images using a local `import` function inside the `mainContainer` creation block. This simplifies access to local state. The `import` function takes a photo, which is a `View`, and a location to place it.

<KPlayground>{`
val import = { photo: View, location: Point ->

}
`}</KPlayground>

Import resizes and centers the photo at the given point. It center-rotates it between -15° and 15°. Finally, a listener is added to the `pressed` pointer event. This moves the photo to the foreground and updates the panel.

<KPlayground>{`
photo.width           = 400.0
photo.position        = location - Point(photo.width / 2, photo.height / 2)
photo.transform       = Identity.rotate(location, (Random.nextFloat() * 30 - 15) * degrees)
photo.pointerChanged += pressed {
    children.move(photo, to = children.size - 1)
    panel.setPhoto(photo)
}
`}</KPlayground>

## Using Gestures

Import also registers a custom gesture listener to support multi-touch scaling and rotations.

<KPlayground>{`
GestureRecognizer(photo).changed += object: GestureListener<GestureEvent> {
    // ...

    override fun started(event: GestureEvent) {
        // capture initial state
        event.consume()
    }

    override fun changed(event: GestureEvent) {
        // 1) calculate rotation angle
        // 2) update photo transform to include rotation
        // 3) update photo bounds based on scaling
        event.consume()
    }

    override fun ended(event: GestureEvent) {
        // simply consume event
        event.consume()
    }
}
`}</KPlayground>

`GestureRecognizer` takes a `View` and emits events whenever it detects motion from 2 or more pointers in that `View`. It also calculates a scale value by comparing the distance between the selected pointers over time.

We register a listener that uses the events to update the photo's `transform` and `bounds`. The listener also consumes events to avoid them making it to subsequent pointer listeners (the `Resizer` used for single pointer manipulation in this case).

#### Capturing Initial Gesture State

We record the state of our photo, and the pointers provided by the `GestureRecognizer` on the `started` event. Notice that `GestureRecognizer` provides locations in the photo's local coordinate. This makes sense for a general-purpose utility and matches the way Doodle reports pointer events. We use these values to modify the photo's bounds though, which is defined in its parent's coordinates. So we map the points into the parent before our calculations.

<KPlayground>{`
override fun started(event: GestureEvent) {
    // Capture initial state to apply deltas with in \`changed\`
    originalSize     = photo.size
    originalCenter   = this@container.toLocal(event.center, photo)
    originalVector   = event.initial[1].inParent(photo) - event.initial[0].inParent(photo)
    originalPosition = photo.position
    initialTransform = photo.transform

    event.consume() // ensure event is consumed from Resizer
}
`}</KPlayground>

#### Handling Gesture Updates

The values recorded in `started` are used--along with the new state--in the `changed` event to update the selected photo.

<KPlayground>{`
override fun changed(event: GestureEvent) {
    val currentVector = event.current[1].inParent(photo) - event.current[0].inParent(photo)

    // Angle between initial set of points and their current locations
    val transformAngle = atan2(
        originalVector.x * currentVector.y - originalVector.y * currentVector.x,
        originalVector.x * currentVector.x + originalVector.y * currentVector.y
    )

    // Use transform for rotation
    photo.transform = initialTransform.rotate(around = originalCenter, by = transformAngle)

    // Update bounds instead of scale transformation
    photo.bounds = Rectangle(
            originalPosition - ((originalPosition - originalCenter) * (1 - event.scale)),
            originalSize * event.scale)

    event.consume() // ensure event is consumed from Resizer
}
`}</KPlayground>
