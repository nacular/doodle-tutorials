This app was inspired by [Selecto's "Diprella Login"](https://dribbble.com/shots/5311359-Diprella-Login). This app is multi-platform, which means it will run in the browser and as a desktop application.

## Project Setup

The app will use a Kotlin Multiplatform setup, which means we can run it on a range of targets supported by Doodle. The directory structure follows a fairly common layout, with common classes and resources in one source set and platform-specific items in their own.

export const sourceTree = sanitize([
{ label: 'src', children: [
    { label: 'commonMain', children: [
        { label: 'kotlin'    },
        { label: 'resources' },
    ] },
    { label: 'jsMain', children: [
        { label: 'kotlin'    },
        { label: 'resources' },
    ] },
    { label: 'jvmMain', children: [{ label: 'kotlin' }] },
    { label: 'wasmJsMain', children: [
        { label: 'kotlin'    },
        { label: 'resources' },
    ] },
]},
{ label: 'build.gradle.kts' }
]);

:::info Directory Layout

<BasicRichTreeView items={sourceTree} defaultExpandedItems={["src", "src/commonMain"]} defaultSelectedItem={"src"}>

<div value="src">

All source code and resources are located under the `src` directory.

The application logic itself is located in the common source set (`src/commonMain`), which means it is entirely reused for each platform. In fact, the same app is used unchanged (just targeting JS) within this documentation.

</div><div value="src/commonMain">

Source code and resources for that are usable for platforms are stored in `commonMain`. This app is designed to work on all platforms, so our app code and all logic is found under this directory.

</div><div value="src/commonMain/kotlin">

The `kotlin` directory is where all code for a platform resides. In this case, we have all the classes for our app, including `AnimatingFormApp` and `AnimatingForm`.

All of these classes are platform agnostic and used by all targets. This makes our app work on any target Doodle supports.

</div><div value="src/commonMain/resources">

The `resources` directory is where resources for a platform resides. In this case, it includes fonts.

</div><div value="src/jsMain">

Source code and resources that are needed for Web (JS) target are stored in `jsMain`. Our app is platform agnostic except for the launch portion, which is located in the source below this directory.

</div><div value="src/jsMain/kotlin">

The Web launch portion of our app is located here in the program's `main` function.

</div><div value="src/jsMain/resources">

Holds the `index.html` file that loads the generated JS file produced for the Web (JS) target.

</div><div value="src/jvmMain">

Source code and resources that are needed for Desktop (JVM) target are stored in `jvmMain`.

</div><div value="src/jvmMain/kotlin">

The Desktop launch portion of our app is located here in the program's `main` function.

</div><div value="src/wasmJsMain">

Source code and resources that are needed for Web (WASM) target are stored in `wasmJsMain`. Our app is platform agnostic except for the launch portion, which is located in the source below this directory.

</div><div value="src/wasmJsMain/kotlin">

The Web launch portion of our app is located here in the program's `main` function.

</div><div value="src/wasmJsMain/resources">

Holds the `index.html` file that loads the generated JS file produced for the Web (WASM) target.

</div><div value="build.gradle.kts">

The `build.gradle.kts` file defines how the app is configured and all its dependencies. The AnimatingForms app uses a multi-platform configuration so it can run on all Doodle supported targets.

</div>

:::

Doodle apps are built using gradle like other Kotlin apps. The build is controlled by the `build.gradle.kts` script in the root of the `AnimatingForm` directory.

**build.gradle.kts**

<KPlayground>{Gradle}</KPlayground>

:::info
The gradle build uses [gradle version catalogs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/version_catalogs.html); see [libs.versions.toml](https://github.com/nacular/doodle-tutorials/blob/master/gradle/libs.versions.toml) file for library info.

## The Application

All Doodle apps must implement the [`Application`](https://nacular.github.io/doodle/docs/applications) interface. The framework will then initialize our app via the constructor. Our app will be fairly simple: just create an instance of our calculator and add it to the display.

Doodle apps can be defined in `commonMain`, since they do not require any platform-specific dependencies (we will do this as well). They can also be [launched](https://nacular.github.io/doodle/docs/applications) in a few different ways on Web and Desktop. Use the `application` function in a platform source-set (i.e. `jsMain`, `jvmMain`, etc.) to launch top-level apps. It takes a list of modules to load and a lambda that builds the app. This lambda is within a Kodein injection context, which means we can inject dependencies into our app via `instance`, `provider`, etc.

:::tip
Notice that `shutdown` is a no-op, since we don't have any cleanup to do when the app closes.

## View Setup

This app uses a single top-level view with 3 layered children to achieve the animation effect. The root view is the [`AnimatingForm`](https://github.com/nacular/doodle-tutorials/blob/master/AnimatingForm/src/commonMain/kotlin/io/nacular/doodle/examples/AnimatingForm.kt#L71) view. It orchestrates its children to pull everything together. It is also responsible for a small portion of the rendering (the rounded corners and "overflowing shapes").

The first child (defined by the [`FormSwitcher`](https://github.com/nacular/doodle-tutorials/blob/master/AnimatingForm/src/commonMain/kotlin/io/nacular/doodle/examples/AnimatingForm.kt#L78) class) contains the sign-in/up button that serves to switch the forms. It also provides the parallax effect through the way it renders its contents.

The other two children represent the sign-in and sign-up forms. They slide back and forth in lock step as the animation progresses. The illusion is achieved by hiding and showing them based on the animation progress. This switch coincides with all 3 views being aligned and the same size, so the `FormSwitcher` hides the change seamlessly.
